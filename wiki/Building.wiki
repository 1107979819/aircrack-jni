# Building aircrack-jni

*This project is a work in progress, do not use for anything.*

= Compile the .so =

First you must build aircrack-ng itself. Specifically we need `libosdep.a`. Download aircrack-ng [http://www.aircrack-ng.org/ source] and unpack somewhere. Go into the directory where you unpacked it and type `make`.

Edit the Makefile in the root of aircrack-jni and change the following lines:

{{{
JDKDIR=[path to your JDK installation]
AIRCRACKNGDIR=[path to where you unpacked the aircrack-ng source]
}}}

Now you should be able to build `aircrack-jni.so` file by simply typing `make`.

= Running aircrack-jni =

You can build the code by typing `ant`. Type `sudo ./run` to run.
